CyborgSmitty:

A python discord bot written to DnD-style raid attack a certain member of a certain server.
Written by etsmit

Req's:
Python 3.7.9
discord.py 1.6.0


Users can type attac to roll a d20. If the roll beats or matches the target's AC, a damage roll is done.
If the target reaches 0 health, the bot changes their discord nickname for a day to reflect this.
==========================


Command : Function

Each player has two actions and can:

    weaken    : lower the boss AC by 1d6 (down to minimum of 2)
    defend    : protect your teammates! 50% chance for the boss to miss their attac!
    buff      : add an extra 1d10 to the rest of the attacs for the day!
    resurrect : (takes 2 actions) resurrect the dead teammate! They come back with 3 actions, +5 to attac roll, and 1d10 damage buff!
